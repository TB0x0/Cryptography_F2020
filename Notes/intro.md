# Introduction

## What is Cryptography

Literal meaning is secret writing. Involves *encryption* of plain text and then *decryption* of cipher text using cryptographic algorithms (also called cryptographic primitives). These are well defined functions with inputs and outputs. Functions can be cascaded to construct cryptographic protocols.

## The Need for Information Security

Everything of value is information:

- Money
- Property
- Voting
- Bills

## What is Security

1. Being free from danger
2. Ensuring all desired assurances are met (things happen the way we expect them to)
