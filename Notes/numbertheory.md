# Finite Groups and Elementary Number Theory

## Groups

A group is a set of elements along with an operation that combines two elements in the group to produce a third element.

A set of elements is considered a group if it satisfies the following conditions:

- Closure - For every a,b in G, a*b is also in G
- Associativity - For every a,b,c in G (a*b)\*c = a*(b*c)
- Identity Element - There exists an identity element i in G that for every a in G a*i = i*a = a
- Inverse: for every a in G there exists an inverse a' such that a*a' = a'\*a = i
