# History and Foundations

Cryptography offers a foundation for assuring digital data

## History of Cryptography

Cryptography was historicaly considered an ad-hoc science of creating ciphers for message encryption. They were usually in the form of text and cipher-text.

Early cipher construction depended on 2 fundamental operations

- Substitution - Replacing one character with another.
- Permutation - Switching characters around.

Modern ciphers are not different from this except they use both operations repeatedly.

These ciphers are trivial to break and with a single plaintext-ciphertext pair the whole cryptographic function is broken.

**A cipher satisfies the requirement of perfect secrecy if it can withstand attacks by an attacker with unlimited computational ability.**
